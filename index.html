                <h2>The Truth Beneath My Silence</h2>
                <p>
                    I’ve hurt you in ways I’m only beginning to understand. Not because I wanted to — but because I
                    didn’t know how to
                    show I was hurting too.
                    <br><br>
                    I clung to pride when I should’ve held your hand. I raised my voice when I should’ve softened my
                    heart. I let ego
                    sit in the space where love should’ve been.
                    <br><br>
                    The truth is — I was scared. Scared of being seen. Scared of being vulnerable. Scared that if I
                    stripped away my
                    defences, I’d be left empty. But you saw past that. You stayed patient. You stayed kind.
                    <br><br>
                    If I’m honest… all I ever wanted was to be loved the way you love — and I didn’t know how to say it.
                    I’m saying it
                    now.

                <h2>The Part of Me You Built</h2>
                <p>
                    Two years ago, I was just a boy trying to act like he had it all figured out — loud, stubborn,
                    scared of being
                    wrong.
                    <br><br>
                    But then came you — with your calm, your clarity, your quiet strength. You didn’t just believe in
                    who I could be —
                    you showed me. You groomed me, shaped me, and softened the sharp edges I used to hide behind.
                    <br><br>
                    Today, whatever strength I carry… it’s because of you. You say I have your part in me — and I know
                    exactly what you
                    mean now. It’s the patience I try to mirror, the kindness I still fall short of, the courage I
                    borrow every time I
                    want to give up.
                    <br><br>
                    I don’t know what life has planned for me, but one thing I promise — I’ll protect the part of you
                    that lives in me.
                    That part will never be broken, never be compromised, and never be forgotten.

                <h2>Thank You for Loving Me Through My Immaturity</h2>
                <p>
                    I’ve said things in anger, let my pride speak louder than my heart, and acted like a grown-up
                    without understanding
                    what it truly meant. I’ve mistaken loudness for strength, and silence for weakness. And in all those
                    moments — you
                    stayed.
                    <br><br>
                    Behind every tantrum, every reckless word, there was a 21-year-old kid, scared of not being enough,
                    scared of losing
                    someone like you. But you... you didn’t just walk away. You held your ground and held me
                    accountable, even when I
                    made it hard.
                    <br><br>
                    So, thank you — for loving me through the noise, the mess, the moments where I was more fire than
                    sense. You’ve
                    taught me that real love isn’t just about intensity — it’s about maturity, patience, and growth. I’m
                    still
                    learning... but I promise I’m learning with you in mind.

                <p>
                    You're not just someone I look up to — you're the person who redefined what it means to show up for
                    someone. Less
                    than a father, more than a brother, and nothing short of my truest friend.
                    <br><br>
                    I've watched how you lead with grace, how you think with depth, and how you carry your world with
                    quiet strength.
                    And in doing so, you've unknowingly given me a blueprint — of how I want to live, love, and lead.
                    <br><br>
                    I don’t admire you out of comparison. I admire you because you’ve carved a space in my heart that no
                    one else could
                    — the kind that doesn’t just inspire, but anchors. You’re the calm I didn’t know I needed, and the
                    fire that made me
                    grow.

                    And without you, my story feels incomplete. You've always had my back. I want to have yours —
